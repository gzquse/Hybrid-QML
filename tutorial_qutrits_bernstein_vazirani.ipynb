    "A qutrit is a basic quantum unit that can exist in a superposition of\n",
    "three possible quantum states, represented as $|0\\rangle$, $|1\\rangle$,\n",
    "and $|2\\rangle$, which functions as a generalization of the qubit. There\n",
    "are many problems to which we can apply these units, among which we can\n",
    "highlight an improved decomposition of the Toffoli gate. Using only\n",
    "qubits, it would take at least 6 CNOTs to decompose the gate, whereas\n",
    "with qutrits it would be enough to use 3. This is one of the reasons why\n",
    "it is important to develop the intuition behind this basic unit of\n",
    "information, to see where qutrits can provide an advantage. The goal of\n",
    "this demo is to start working with qutrits from an algorithmic point of\n",
    "view. To do so, we will start with the Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm,\n",
    "which we will initially explore using qubits, and later using qutrits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm\n",
    "-----------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by\n",
    "Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani. It was one of the first examples\n",
    "that demonstrated an exponential advantage of a quantum computer over a\n",
    "traditional one. So, in this first section we will understand the\n",
    "problem that they tackled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is some hidden bit string \\\"a\\\" that we are trying to\n",
    "learn, and that we have access to a function $f(\\vec{x})$ that\n",
    "implements the following scalar product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\vec{x}) := \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{x} \\pmod 2,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec{a}=(a_0,a_1,...,a_{n-1})$ and\n",
    "$\\vec{x}=(x_0,x_1,...,x_{n-1})$ are bit strings of length $n$ with\n",
    "$a_i, x_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$. Our challenge will be to discover the hidden\n",
    "value of $\\vec{a}$ by using the function $f$. We don\\'t know anything\n",
    "about $\\vec{a}$ so the only thing we can do is to evaluate $f$ at\n",
    "different points $\\vec{x}$ with the idea of gaining hidden information.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, let\\'s imagine that we take $\\vec{x}=(1,0,1)$ and\n",
    "get the value $f(\\vec{x}) = 0$. Although it may not seem obvious,\n",
    "knowing the structure that $f$ has, this gives us some information about\n",
    "$\\vec{a}$. In this case, $a_0$ and $a_2$ have the same value. This is\n",
    "because taking that value of $\\vec{x}$, the function will be equivalent\n",
    "to $a_0 + a_2 \\pmod 2$, which will only take the value 0 if they are\n",
    "equal. I invite you to take your time to think of a possible strategy\n",
    "(at the classical level) in order to determine $\\vec{a}$ with the\n",
    "minimum number of evaluations of the function $f$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal solution requires only $n$ calls to the function! Let\\'s see\n",
    "how we can do this. Knowing the form of $\\vec{a}$ and $\\vec{x}$, we can\n",
    "rewrite $f$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\vec{x})=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_ix_i \\pmod 2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy will be to deduce one element of $\\vec{a}$ with each call\n",
    "to the function. Imagine that we want to determine the value $a_i$. We\n",
    "can simply choose $\\vec{x}$ as a vector of all zeros except a one in the\n",
    "i-th position, since in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\vec{x})= 0\\cdot a_0 + 0\\cdot a_1 + ... + 1\\cdot a_i + ... + 0\\cdot a_{n-1} \\pmod 2 \\quad= a_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is trivial to see, therefore, that $n$ evaluations of $f$ are needed.\n",
    "The question is: can we do it more efficiently with a quantum computer?\n",
    "The answer is yes, and in fact, we only need to make one call to the\n",
    "function!\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to see how we can represent this statement in a\n",
    "circuit. In this case, we will assume that we have an oracle $U_f$ that\n",
    "encodes the function, as we can see in the picture below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Oracle representation of the\n",
    "function.](../_static/demonstration_assets/qutrits_bernstein_vazirani/oracle_qutrit.jpg){.align-center}\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $U_f$ sends the state $|\\vec{x} \\rangle |y\\rangle$ to the\n",
    "state $| \\vec{x} \\rangle |y + \\vec{a} \\cdot \\vec{x} \\pmod{2} \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, for example, that $\\vec{a}=[0,1,0]$. Then\n",
    "$U_f|111\\rangle |0\\rangle = |111\\rangle|1\\rangle$, since we are\n",
    "evaluating $f$ at the point $\\vec{x} = [1,1,1]$. The scalar product\n",
    "between the two values is $1$, so the last qubit of the output will take\n",
    "the value $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm makes use of this oracle according to\n",
    "the following circuit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bernstein--Vazirani\n",
    "algorithm.](../_static/demonstration_assets/qutrits_bernstein_vazirani/bernstein_vazirani_algorithm.jpg){.align-center}\n",
    "\n",
    "What we can see is that, by simply using Hadamard gates before and after\n",
    "the oracle, after a single run, the output of the circuit is exactly the\n",
    "hidden value of $\\vec{a}$. Let\\'s do a little math to verify that this\n",
    "is so.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the input to our circuit is $|0001\\rangle$. The second step is to\n",
    "apply Hadamard gates to this state, and for this we must use the\n",
    "following property:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H^{\\otimes n}|\\vec{x}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}}\\sum_{\\vec{z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^n}(-1)^{\\vec{x}\\cdot\\vec{z}}|\\vec{z}\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking as input the value $|0001\\rangle$, we obtain the state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\phi_1\\rangle=H^{\\otimes 4}|0001\\rangle = H^{\\otimes 3}|000\\rangle\\otimes H|1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^3}}\\left(\\sum_{z \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}|\\vec{z}\\rangle\\right)\\left(\\frac{|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, we have separated the first three qubits from the fourth\n",
    "for clarity. If we now apply our operator $U_f$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\phi_2\\rangle= U_f |\\phi_1\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^3}}\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}|\\vec{z}\\rangle\\frac{|\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z} \\pmod 2\\rangle-|1 + \\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z} \\pmod 2\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the value of $f(\\vec{x})$, the final part of the expression\n",
    "can take two values and it can be checked that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\phi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^3}}\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}|\\vec{z}\\rangle(-1)^{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}}\\frac{|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because, if $\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}$ takes the value $0$, we will\n",
    "have the $\\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$, and if it takes the\n",
    "value $1$, the result will be\n",
    "$\\frac{|1\\rangle - |0\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}} = - \\frac{|0\\rangle - |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n",
    "Therefore, by calculating $(-1)^{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}}$ we cover both\n",
    "cases. After this, we can include the $(-1)^{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}}$\n",
    "factor in the $|\\vec{z}\\rangle$ term and disregard the last qubit, since\n",
    "we are not going to use it again:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\phi_2\\rangle =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^3}}\\sum_{\\vec{z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}(-1)^{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}}|\\vec{z}\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you cannot always disregard a qubit. In cases where there is\n",
    "entanglement with other qubits that is not possible, but in this case\n",
    "the state is separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will reapply the property of the first step to calculate the\n",
    "result after using the Hadamard:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\phi_3\\rangle = H^{\\otimes 3}|\\phi_2\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2^3}\\sum_{\\vec{z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}(-1)^{\\vec{a}\\cdot\\vec{z}}\\left(\\sum_{\\vec{y} \\in \\{0,1\\}^3}(-1)^{\\vec{z}\\cdot\\vec{y}}|\\vec{y}\\rangle\\right).$$\n",

    "Rearranging this expression, we obtain:\n",

    "==========\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we have practised the use of basic qutrit gates such as\n",
    "TShift or THadamard by applying the Bernstein--Vazirani algorithm. In\n",
    "this case, the generalization has been straightforward and we have found\n",
    "that it makes mathematical sense, but we cannot always substitute qubit\n",
    "gates for qutrit gates as we have seen in the demo. To give an easy\n",
    "example of this, we know the property that $X = HZH$, but it turns out\n",
    "that this property does not generalize! The general property is actually\n",
    "$X = H^{\\dagger}ZH$. In the case of qubits it holds that\n",
    "$H = H^{\\dagger}$, but in other dimensions it does not. I invite you to\n",
    "continue practising with other types of algorithms. For instance, will\n",
